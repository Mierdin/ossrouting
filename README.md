"ossrouting" is a simple three-VM environment for performing routing using open source software.

# Getting Started

Please see my [blog post](http://keepingitclassless.net/2015/06/open-source-routing-practical/) for detailed instructions on how to get this environment set up.

In short, you can run "vagrant up" and the environment will spin up already configured. You will have to connect to the "r2" virtual machine to start the ExaBGP process.
